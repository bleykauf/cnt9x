                If you are on Linux, you need to install via pip:
                    - pyvisa-py
                    - pyusb

                Then you have to do:
                    sudo groupadd usbusers
                    sudo usermod -a -G usbusers USERNAME
                    nano  /etc/udev/rules.d/99-com.rules

                    add the following line:

                    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", MODE="0666", GROUP="usbusers"

                    save the changes:

                    /etc/init.d/udev  restart

                    reboot
